# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the kirogeist automated smoke testing system by improving test reporting capabilities, adding better error categorization, and implementing automated test scheduling with enhanced notification systems. The goal is to make the testing process more efficient and provide better insights into PHP application health during migration and ongoing maintenance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want enhanced error categorization and reporting so that I can quickly identify and prioritize the most critical issues in my PHP application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects PHP errors THEN it SHALL categorize them by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include error trend analysis over time
3. WHEN multiple test runs are completed THEN the system SHALL provide comparison reports showing improvement or regression
4. IF an error occurs in multiple endpoints THEN the system SHALL group related errors and show affected URL count
5. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL generate a summary dashboard with actionable insights

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test scheduling and notifications so that I can monitor my application health continuously without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure a test schedule THEN the system SHALL automatically run tests at specified intervals
2. WHEN critical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications via email or webhook
3. WHEN test results show significant changes THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders automatically
4. IF a scheduled test fails to run THEN the system SHALL log the failure and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include relevant error details and direct links to full reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want historical test data and analytics so that I can track application quality trends and make informed decisions about releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL store historical data for trend analysis
2. WHEN viewing reports THEN I SHALL see quality metrics over time with visual charts
3. WHEN comparing time periods THEN the system SHALL highlight significant changes in error patterns
4. IF error rates exceed defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL flag quality concerns
5. WHEN generating executive reports THEN the system SHALL provide high-level summaries suitable for non-technical stakeholders

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want API endpoints for test automation integration so that I can incorporate smoke testing into CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints for triggering tests
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the API SHALL return structured results suitable for pipeline decisions
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate requests using API keys or tokens
4. IF test results indicate failures THEN the API SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes for pipeline control
5. WHEN API responses are generated THEN they SHALL include detailed error information and report URLs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want improved configuration management and multi-project support so that I can efficiently manage testing for multiple PHP applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing multiple projects THEN the system SHALL support project-specific configurations
2. WHEN configuring tests THEN I SHALL be able to define project templates for consistent setup
3. WHEN projects have different requirements THEN the system SHALL allow custom error patterns and fix rules per project
4. IF configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate settings before applying them
5. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL maintain separate test histories and reports
